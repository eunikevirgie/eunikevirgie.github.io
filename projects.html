    </h2>
    <p style= "text-align: justify; margin-top: 6px;">
        This project examines how Singapore’s tourism sector recovered from the COVID-19 shock between 2019 and 2025, and whether the structure of visitor markets has returned to its pre-pandemic pattern or shifted to a new normal. 
        Using seven interactive visualisations, the analysis tracks recovery dynamics over time, compares performance across source markets, and explores structural changes in Singapore’s tourism economy.

            <h2 style="text-align: justify;">1. The Overall Recovery Path</h2>
                <h3 style="text-align: justify;">International visitor arrivals collapsed sharply in early 2020 and remained near zero through much of 2021. While arrivals rebounded after borders reopened in 2022, indexed comparisons show that total arrivals have not consistently returned to pre-pandemic levels, indicating an incomplete and volatile recovery.</h3>

            I clean and reshape the data in Python (Google Colab), group markets into regions, and construct a 2019=100 index before exporting a tidy CSV for Vega-Lite.

                <h3 style="text-align: justify;">This map shows that Singapore’s tourism recovery was highly uneven across source countries, particularly during the early reopening phase. While aggregate arrivals remained extremely low through 2021, a small number of countries began to recover earlier than others. By 2021Q4, Bangladesh recorded the highest recovery index (31.6), followed by Myanmar (11.7) and India (10.7), while most other markets remained below an index value of 5.<br><br>

            <strong>Data:</strong>
            This visualization builds on the same SingStat arrivals data and 2019=100 index construction described in Figure 1. The additional steps involve disaggregating arrivals to the country level, aggregating monthly data to quarters, and matching countries to ISO3 codes for spatial mapping. Countries without SingStat country-level data are displayed in grey to preserve global context. The map is implemented in Vega-Lite with a quarter slider that filters the data dynamically.
