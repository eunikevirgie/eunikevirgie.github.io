        <strong>Aims</strong><br>
    </h2>
    <p style= "text-align: justify; margin-top: 6px;">
        This project examines how Singapore’s tourism sector recovered from the COVID-19 shock between 2019 and 2025, and whether the structure of visitor markets has returned to its pre-pandemic pattern or shifted to a new normal. 
        Using seven interactive visualisations, the analysis tracks recovery dynamics over time, compares performance across source markets, and explores structural changes in Singapore’s tourism economy.

            <h2 style="text-align: justify;">The Overall Recovery Path</h2>
                <h3 style="text-align: justify;">Interpretation: International visitor arrivals to Singapore collapsed sharply in early 2020 and remained near zero through much of 2021. 
                    Although arrivals rebounded following border reopening in 2022, indexed comparisons show that total visitor volumes have not consistently returned to pre-pandemic levels. The aggregate trend therefore points to an incomplete and uneven recovery, masking substantial variation beneath the headline totals.

            <strong>Data:</strong>
            Monthly international visitor arrivals by place of residence are retrieved from the Singapore Department of Statistics <a href="https://data.gov.sg/datasets/d_d1c33009b674dcf70b8e8c790b793f28/view">(SingStat)</a>.
            The data are cleaned and reshaped in Python using Google Colab, with individual markets grouped into regional categories. A recovery index (2019 = 100) is constructed and exported as a tidy CSV for visualization in Vega-Lite.

            <h2 style="text-align:left;">The Geography of Recovery: <br>Uneven and Asynchronous Reopening</h2>
                <h3 style="text-align: justify;">Disaggregating the aggregate recovery reveals substantial geographic divergence across source countries. During the early reopening phase, only a small set of markets recorded meaningful recovery. By 2021Q4, Bangladesh showed the highest recovery index (31.6), followed by Myanmar (11.7) and India (10.7), while most countries remained below an index value of 5.<br><br>
                This uneven pattern suggests that recovery was driven less by global tourism conditions and more by asynchronous border reopening and region-specific travel policies. Countries that reopened earlier or maintained more flexible outbound travel arrangements resumed limited travel to Singapore ahead of others. Although recovery broadened across regions during 2022–2023, the map indicates that convergence toward pre-pandemic levels remained incomplete, with persistent disparities across markets.

            <strong>Data:</strong>
            This visualization builds on the same SingStat arrivals data and 2019 = 100 index constructed in Figure 1. Additional steps include disaggregating arrivals to the country level, aggregating monthly data to quarterly frequency, and matching countries to ISO3 codes for spatial mapping. Countries without country-level SingStat data are displayed in grey to preserve global context. The map is implemented in Vega-Lite with an interactive quarter slider.

                <h3 style="text-align: justify;">Building on the temporal and spatial patterns identified earlier, this scorecard summarizes recovery outcomes by market group relative to 2019. 
                    While West Asia and Oceania have surpassed pre-COVID arrival levels, most Asian and long-haul markets remain below their pre-pandemic benchmarks, highlighting a structurally uneven recovery rather than a uniform rebound.

            This scorecard summarizes recovery outcomes using the same SingStat arrivals data and 2019 = 100 index constructed in Figures 1 and 2. Average monthly arrivals in 2019 are compared with average arrivals from 2024 to the latest available month to compute a recovery index by market group. The residual “Others” category is excluded due to its negligible pre-COVID baseline.
