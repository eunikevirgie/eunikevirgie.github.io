                UK Labor Market Over the Coronavirus Pandemic
                Using the most common metric of labour market performance (unemployment), not much can be observed over the whole of the pandemic that was unusual. Prior to 2020, the UK labour market had been performing rather well, with the national unemployment rate hovering around 4-5%. But the weekly unemployment rate in the first months of the Covid-19 crisis was well below the average of the past five years.

                There has also not been any obvious reduction in wages. In the 2008-11 downturn, there were notable wage freezes for many workers, which arguably mitigated the need for mass layoffs. Yet data shows that average weekly wage levels (adjusted for inflation) appear to have grown strongly over the crisis.
