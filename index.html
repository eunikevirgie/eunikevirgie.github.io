        - The <h1> tag defines a large heading
        - The <p> tag defines a paragraph
        - Tags appear as an opening <div> and closing </div> pair

            <h2>Section 1: The Rise and Fall of UK Oil Prices</h2>
            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                The chart tracks how UK oil prices swung dramatically between 1960 and 1990. For over a decade, prices barely moved—then the 1970s hit, and everything changed. A global oil crisis sent prices soaring to nearly $40 a barrel by 1980 before tumbling again through the decade. By the late ’80s, the market stirred once more, reminding the world that oil never stays still for long.
